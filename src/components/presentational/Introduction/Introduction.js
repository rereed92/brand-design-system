            <p>As AND Digital continues to grow in terms of people, geographies and clients, one challenge we are faced with is learning how to apply the AND Digital brand cohesively to each of our digital products.</p>
            <p>This Design System is aimed to act as a central location where we house a live inventory of UI components, digital brand guidelines, brand assets, code snippets, code guidelines and more. Anyone working on an AND Digital product is strongly encouraged to stay familiar with this design system and help ensure that it is kept up-to-date.</p>
            <p>This Design System has space for flexibility, and is continuously revised and expanded to suit changing product needs. If you have any suggestions just get in touch:</p>
